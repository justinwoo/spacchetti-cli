## [Unreleased]

Other improvements:
- Log backend build command if used

## [0.12.1] - 2019-11-17

Bugfixes:
- Fix macOS release artifact (#503, #504)
- Complete parser implementation for module declarations, for `spago test` (#499)

Other improvements:
- Docs: fix typo in README (#498)
- Errors: use `logWarn` for all warnings (#501)

## [0.12.0] - 2019-11-15

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Revert back to dynamically linked binary on Linux (#502, #500, #497)**

  The static binary was still dynamically linking to `glibc`, causing it to be broken on
  some distros. So for now we're back on a dynamically-linked executable.

## [0.11.1] - 2019-11-12

This is identical to `0.11.0`, but published under a new version number due to mishaps in the publishing CI process.

## [0.11.0] - 2019-11-12

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Remove `psc-package`-related commands (#423, #425)**

  Since we are approaching a stable release and `spago` feature set is a superset of `psc-package` ones,
  from this release we do not support the commands to interop with `psc-package`:
  `psc-package-local-setup`, `psc-package-insdhall` and `psc-package-clean` commands.
- **Build static binaries for Linux (#437, 427)**

  This should fix the dynamic-library-compatibility problems on some distributions.
  It should work as well as the old dynamic binary, but it's theoretically a breaking change since
  some behaviours might be different.
- **Move all logging to `stderr` (#256, #475, #476, #486)**

  All "business output" (e.g. `spago sources`) will stay on `stdout`, so in practice everything
  should be fine, but this is theoretically a breaking change since someone might be depending
  on the output we had so far.


New features:
- add support for `spago build` and `spago run` with alternate backends (#355, #426, #452, #435)

  E.g: add the key `backend = "psgo"` in `spago.dhall` to compile/run with `psgo`
- add support for sharing the `output` folder in monorepos, to reduce build duplication.

  Pass `--no-share-output` flag to disable this behavior (#377, #422)
- add new command `spago path` that returns the paths used in the project.

  E.g. `spago path output` returns the output path so that it can be shared with tools such as `purs-loader`. (#463)
- `spago docs` now displays a link to the generated docs' `index.html`, and opens them in the browser when passed the `--open` flag (#379, #421)
- `spago init` has new `--no-comments` flag which skips adding tutorial comments to the generated `spago.dhall` and `packages.dhall` files (#417, #428)
- `spago verify-set` now compiles everything, to detect duplicate module names. This can be disabled with `--no-check-modules-unique` (#438)
- `spago install purescript-XYZ` will now strip `purescript-` prefix and install XYZ (if it exists in package set) instead of just failing with a warning (#367, #443)
- `spago run` now allows to pipe `stdin` to your running project (#488, #490)

Bugfixes:
- Fix Ctrl-C handling in REPL when using NPM installation on Windows (#493, #483)
- Fix confusing warning when trying to `spago install` a package already present in project dependencies list (#436, #439)
- Warn (but don't error) when trying to `--watch` missing directories (#406, #420, #447, #448)
- Do not watch files in `.spago` folder when running with `--watch` (#430, #446)
- The `--clear-screen` flag (usable e.g. with `spago build --watch`) now also resets cursor position, so the rebuild message always appears at top left of the screen (#465, #466)
- Allow additional fields in the config for local packages (#470)
- Fix `--config` option: get the correct paths when config file is in another directory (#478, #484)

Other improvements:
- Tests: speed up test suite by replacing some end-to-end tests with unit/property tests (#445, #440)
- Tests: update instructions to run tests (#449)
- Tests: always run test suites with UTF8 encoding (#482)
- Docs: various improvements to README (#432, #457, #464, #487)
- Docs: add "getting started" guides for Parcel, Webpack and Nodemon (#456, #461, #473)
- Errors: improve cache skipping error (#453, #480, #481)
- Errors: add a nice error message when trying to run `spago test` with no test modules (#489, #383, #492)
- Refactor: fix `hlint` warnings (#450)
- Refactor: rewrite Curator for moar maintainability (#458, #419)
- Deps: update to Dhall 1.27 and Purs 0.13.4 (#469)
- Deps: revert to GHC 8.4.4 and LTS-12 (#479)
- CI: fix release code (#494, #495)


## [0.10.0] - 2019-09-21

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Flags and arguments that you want to give to `purs` are now passed with `--purs-args` (#353, #366)**

  The previous behaviour in which all arguments that could not parse as `spago` arguments
  were passed along to `purs` was sometimes confusing (e.g. when using `--path` and multiple
  arguments).

New features:
- Support watching js files (#407, #205)
- New `--no-search` flag for `spago docs` to skip patching the documentation using `purescript-docs-search` (#400)
- New `-x` flag for specifying the config path location (#357, #329)
- New `spago login` command, to save a GitHub token to the cache so it can be used for various operations hitting GitHub (#391, #403)

Bugfixes:
- "Quit" command in watch mode now actually quits (#390, #389)
- Do not compile files twice when using `--watch` and Vim (#346, #371)
- Use `git clone` instead of `git fetch` when fetching a package, so all tags can be installed (#373, #374)
- Fix Windows global cache location; now uses `LocalAppData` as default (#384, #380)
- Fix naming clash in short flag for repl dependencies (#352, #350)
- Fix failure to copy to global cache on a different filesystem (#385, #386)
- Fix watch function on Windows (issue with paths) (#387, #380, #401)
- Look up remote imports dynamically when doing frozen check, to always find the right `packages.dhall` (#349, #402)

Other Improvements:
- Performance: make no-op `spago install` faster (#409, #412)
- CI: remove reviews limitation on mergify (#354)
- CI: various fixes (#362, #368, #382, #388, #418)
- Docs: fix syntax errors in template comment (#369, #413, #408)
- Docs: fix link for package-set from commit (#405)
- Docs: keep README up to date with new features (#398, #347)
- Deps: upgrade to lts-14 and GHC-8.6 (#395)
- Deps: upgrade to dhall-1.26.0, v10 of the standard (#411, #358)

## [0.9.0] - 2019-07-30

Breaking changes (!!!):
- **Rename `package-set-upgrade` to `upgrade-set` (#336)**

  You now have to call `spago upgrade-set` if you wish to upgrade your package-sets version

- **Move the `--jobs` flag to be global (#338)**

  If you were invoking spago in this way: `spago install -j 10`, you now have to use `spago -j 10 install` instead

- **Import local packages `as Location` (#301, #244)**

  Before you'd import a local package in this way:

  ```dhall
  let additions =
    { foobar =
        mkPackage
          (../foobar/spago.dhall).dependencies
          "../foobar"
          "local-fix-whatever"
    }
  ```

  ..but now you'll have to import it using `as Location` instead:

  ```dhall
  let additions =
    { foobar = ../foobar/spago.dhall as Location }
  ```


New features:
- Add searchbar to docs generated with `spago docs` (#340, #333, #89)
- Add automatic migration of Bower projects when doing `spago init` (#159, #272, #342)
- Add `bump-version` command, for generating `bower.json` files and making version tags in Git (#203, #289, #324)
- Use `psa` for compiling if installed; you can avoid this with the new `--no-psa` flag (#305, #283, #252, #327)
- Add support for starting a repl within a folder which has not been setup as a spago project (#168, #280)
- Add `--format` flag to `spago docs` (#294, #299)
- Add project sources to `spago sources` output (#276, #287, #308)
- Watch all sources, including dependencies, when building with filewatch (#172, #309)
- Add `--deps-only` flag to build dependencies alone (#330, #331)

Bugfixes:

- Change `--node-args` shortcut to `-a` to avoid clash (#292, #293)
- Stop reformatting config files if not necessary (#300, #302, #339)
- Make `spago run` write a file and execute it so that args are passed correctly (#297, #295)
- Add fallback for global cache directory (#314, #312)
- Do not overwrite `spago.dhall` when doing `spago init` twice (#318, #321)
- Catch exceptions when trying to fetch metadata (#325)
- Generate hashes when doing `psc-package-insdhall` (#337, #240)

- Make file embedding indipendent of the locale when compiling; now we just use Unicode

## [0.6.0] - 2018-12-16

First release under the name "spago".

Main changes from the previous "spacchetti-cli" incarnation:
- Rename `spacchetti-cli` → `spago` (#23)
- Publish on NPM under the new name `purescript-spago` (#35)
- Add some commands from `psc-package`:
  - `init` (#12): initialize a new sample project with a `spago.dhall` and a `packages.dhall` config files
  - `install` (#11, #32): concurrently fetch dependencies declared in `spago.dhall` file
  - `sources` (#13): print source globs
  - `build`: compile the project with `purs`
- Migrate old commands from `spacchetti-cli` that are specific to local psc-package projects:
  - `local-setup` is now `psc-package-local-setup`
  - `insdhall` is now `psc-package-insdhall`
  - `clean` is now `psc-package-clean`
- Add some commands from `purp` (#26):
  - `test`: compile and run a module from the `test/` folder
  - `bundle`: bundle all sources in a single file
  - `make-module`: export the above bundle so it can be `require`d from js
- Stop depending on `dhall` and `dhall-to-json` commands and instead depend on `dhall` and `dhall-json` libraries
- Freeze `spacchetti` package-set import in `packages.dhall`, so `dhall` caching works for subsequent executions
- Move to v4.0.0 of `dhall`
- Add integration tests for most of the commands (#31, #30)
