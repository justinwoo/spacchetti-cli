## [0.7.0] - 2019-03-03

Breaking changes:
- The NPM package `purescript-spago` is now deprecated. New releases will be published only to the package `spago` (#115, #44)  
  You can install the package with `npm install -g spago`
- [Spacchetti has been merged in the official package-set](https://github.com/purescript/package-sets/pull/271): this means that `spago` will now use that as the reference package-set. (#120)  
  As a result of this, the command `spago spacchetti-upgrade` has been renamed to `spago package-set-upgrade`.

New features:
- Support Windows in NPM install (#121, #109)  
- Add `spago freeze` command to recompute hashes of the package-set (#113)
- Add `spago verify` and `spago verify-set` commands (#108, #14)

- Check that the version of the installed compiler is at least what the package-set requires (#101, #107, #117, #116) 

Other improvements:
- Improve the installation: do less work and print less useless stuff (#110, #112, #114) 
- Skip the copy of template files if the source directories exist (#102, #105)

## [0.6.4] - 2019-02-07

New features:
- [`spago init` will search for a `psc-package.json`, and try to port it to your new `spago.dhall` config](https://github.com/spacchetti/spago/tree/6947bf1e9721b4e8a5e87ba8a546a7e9c83153e9#switching-from-psc-package) (#76)

- [Now it's possible to run `spago install foo bar` to add new dependencies to your project](https://github.com/spacchetti/spago/tree/6947bf1e9721b4e8a5e87ba8a546a7e9c83153e9#adding-a-dependency) (#74)
- Now every time you try to build, Spago will also check that dependencies are installed (#75, #82)

Bugfixes:
- Spago would crash if `$HOME` was not set, now it doesn't anymore (#85, #90)

## [0.6.2] - 2019-01-07

New features:
- `spago build` and `spago test` now have the `--path` option to specify custom source paths to include (#68, #69)
- `spago build` and `spago test` can now pass options straight to `purs compile` (#66, #49)

## [0.6.1] - 2018-12-26

New features:

- Print `git` output in case of failure when doing `install` (#54, #59) 
- Include building `src/*` when running `test` (#50, #53)
- Make file embedding indipendent of the locale when compiling; now we just use Unicode

## [0.6.0] - 2018-12-16

First release under the name "spago".

Main changes from the previous "spacchetti-cli" incarnation:
- Rename `spacchetti-cli` â†’ `spago` (#23)
- Publish on NPM under the new name `purescript-spago` (#35)
- Add some commands from `psc-package`:
  - `init` (#12): initialize a new sample project with a `spago.dhall` and a `packages.dhall` config files
  - `install` (#11, #32): concurrently fetch dependencies declared in `spago.dhall` file
  - `sources` (#13): print source globs
  - `build`: compile the project with `purs`
- Migrate old commands from `spacchetti-cli` that are specific to local psc-package projects:
  - `local-setup` is now `psc-package-local-setup`
  - `insdhall` is now `psc-package-insdhall`
  - `clean` is now `psc-package-clean`
- Add some commands from `purp` (#26):
  - `test`: compile and run a module from the `test/` folder
  - `bundle`: bundle all sources in a single file
  - `make-module`: export the above bundle so it can be `require`d from js
- Stop depending on `dhall` and `dhall-to-json` commands and instead depend on `dhall` and `dhall-json` libraries
- Freeze `spacchetti` package-set import in `packages.dhall`, so `dhall` caching works for subsequent executions
- Move to v4.0.0 of `dhall`
- Add integration tests for most of the commands (#31, #30)
