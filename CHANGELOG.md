and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Bugfixes:
- Do not compile files twice when using `--watch` and Vim (#346)

## [0.9.0] - 2019-07-30

Breaking changes (!!!):
- **Rename `package-set-upgrade` to `upgrade-set` (#336)**

  You now have to call `spago upgrade-set` if you wish to upgrade your package-sets version

- **Move the `--jobs` flag to be global (#338)**

  If you were invoking spago in this way: `spago install -j 10`, you now have to use `spago -j 10 install` instead

- **Import local packages `as Location` (#301, #244)**

  Before you'd import a local package in this way:

  ```dhall
  let additions =
    { foobar =
        mkPackage
          (../foobar/spago.dhall).dependencies
          "../foobar"
          "local-fix-whatever"
    }
  ```

  ..but now you'll have to import it using `as Location` instead:

  ```dhall
  let additions =
    { foobar = ../foobar/spago.dhall as Location }
  ```

## [0.6.0] - 2018-12-16

First release under the name "spago".

Main changes from the previous "spacchetti-cli" incarnation:
- Rename `spacchetti-cli` â†’ `spago` (#23)
- Publish on NPM under the new name `purescript-spago` (#35)
- Add some commands from `psc-package`:
  - `init` (#12): initialize a new sample project with a `spago.dhall` and a `packages.dhall` config files
  - `install` (#11, #32): concurrently fetch dependencies declared in `spago.dhall` file
  - `sources` (#13): print source globs
  - `build`: compile the project with `purs`
- Migrate old commands from `spacchetti-cli` that are specific to local psc-package projects:
  - `local-setup` is now `psc-package-local-setup`
  - `insdhall` is now `psc-package-insdhall`
  - `clean` is now `psc-package-clean`
- Add some commands from `purp` (#26):
  - `test`: compile and run a module from the `test/` folder
  - `bundle`: bundle all sources in a single file
  - `make-module`: export the above bundle so it can be `require`d from js
- Stop depending on `dhall` and `dhall-to-json` commands and instead depend on `dhall` and `dhall-json` libraries
- Freeze `spacchetti` package-set import in `packages.dhall`, so `dhall` caching works for subsequent executions
- Move to v4.0.0 of `dhall`
- Add integration tests for most of the commands (#31, #30)
